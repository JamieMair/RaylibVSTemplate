# RaylibVSTemplate
 A template VS 2019 C++ project for the Raylib library

## Getting Started
In order to use this you must install the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library (windows version). The default location is to install to C:\raylib which is what is assumed for the project settings. If you have installed Raylib in another location, you should change the paths as appropriate.

Secondly, you must build the raylib library from source (found at C:\raylib\raylib\projects\VS2017) to both Debug and Release modes, otherwise you may get a missing library error.
